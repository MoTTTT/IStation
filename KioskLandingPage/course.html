<B><FONT SIZE=+1>What is the Internet?</FONT></B>

<P>The internet is a network of interconnected computers spanning the globe.
It was started in the late 60's at the behest of the USA's department of
Defense in order to reduce the impact a nuclear strike would have on America's
computing abilities. Its original function was the exchange of information
between scientists, research facilities and&nbsp; government officials.
The advantages of information exchange was obvious and soon computer resources
outside the US started linking to the network, resources were also made
available to smaller computer networks and finally to individuals. The
real driving force behind the growth of the Internet was the commercialisation
of the Net. Companies now not only have access to huge amounts of information
but are actively advertising and selling their products and services on
the Internet.

<P>The internet workstation is connected by means of a dial-up telephone
line to an ISP( Internet Service Provider) whose network is permanently
connected to the Internet. The ISP thus provides Internet connectivity
to the workstation. Once connected to the Ineternet, the ISP and the rest
of the Internet routes your request to view a webpage to the correct webserver
(computer with webpages loaded on it). The requested document is downloaded
to your machine allowing you to view the information.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Web browser</FONT></B>

<P>Access to the information on the Internet have been made more user-friendly
with the introduction of web pages. Web pages are documents making use
of hypertext to link it to other web pages which in turn is linked to other
pages resulting in a web of inter-connected documents. The hypertext documents
are viewed in a graphical tool called a web browser e.g. Netscape or Internet
Explorer. By simply clicking with a mouse on a hypertext link in a document
while viewing it in the web browser, the user is immediately transported
to another position in either the same web page or another web page which
could sit on a computer on the other side of the world.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Desktop environment</FONT></B>

<P>The internet workstation is running the Linux operating system - the
operating system provides the computing environment in which user programs
and applications operate. The graphical desktop environment in which Netscape
is running, is known as Gnome. It is a windows environment allowing for
drag-and-drop functionality. The user can navigate between 4 paged desktop
screens by clicking with the mouse on one of the four small blocks in the
middle of the movable menu bar at the bottom of the desktop screen.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Netscape essentials</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>
To start Netscape click on the Netscape icon on the menu bar at the bottom
of the screen.</LI>

<LI>
A Netscape window will appear.</LI>

<LI>
Essential Netscape features:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>URL (Universal Resource Locator) text field</B> - indicate the address
of the web page displayed in the web browser. To view a web page type the
address of the desired web page into this text field and press the "Enter"
key on the keyboard. Each web page on the web has a unique address conforming
to the URL format:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Indicate what tool the web browser uses to get to the target page.</LI>

<LI>
What computer the web page is on.</LI>

<LI>
Specific instructions necessary to locate the web page on the target computer,
such as directory and sub directory paths.</LI>

<LI>
The target file name.</LI>
</UL>
Example:
<BR>http://www.ireality.co.za/sports/skyrider/Welcome.htm

<P>http - hypertext document to be viewed.
<BR>www.ireality.co.za - the address (domain name) of the target computer.
"www" - world wide web", "ireality" name specific to target computer, "co"
indicate that the computer belongs to a commercial company, "za" indicate
the country in which the computer is situated, in this example in South
Africa. Note that computers in the USA leave the country option blank.
<BR>/sports/skyrider/ - the directories and sub directories in which the
target file is situated.
<BR>Welcome.htm - the name of the target file
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>BACK and FORWARD buttons - </B>The BACK button takes you back to the
previous document. You can also choose BACK from the VIEW pull down menu
bar. The FORWARD button takes you forward to a page you have just come
from and on which you used the BACK button.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>SAVE command - </B>The SAVE AS option in your FILE pull down menu, allows
you to save the file that is currently in your browser's window.You are
given the option of saving the page as text or as a source. If you save
as source, you are saving the HTML coding which lies behind the web page.
Text will save the text on the page. The graphics will not be saved in
either case as they are separate files that are linked to the web page.
Images can be saved by clicking with the right mouse button on the image
in the web page and selecting the "Save ImageAs..." option.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>PRINT command</B> - The print command allows you to print the web page
that is currently open in the web browser's window. The command can be
found in the FILE pull down menu. Alternatively you can use the PRINT button
on the button bar.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>STOP button - </B>In some cases a page needs only to partially load
to be able to see the information you require from the page. In this case,
you can use the STOP button to stop the page from loading completely. This
is very useful as it allows for more control and can save time when downloading
pages.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>RELOAD button</B> - The RELOAD button can load a page that has been
stopped from loading completely or when there has been some other break
in the transfer of the web page to your computer.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>BOOKMARKS</B> and <B>HISTORY</B> - Bookmarks allow you to easily access
frequently visited web pages. Select the "bookmark" pull down menu from
the menu bar. The menu is separated into two functional sections, the first
section allows you to add the currently open web page to the bookmarks
list by clicking "Add Bookmark". The second section which is separated
from the first section by a line, lists all the bookmarks in your bookmark
file by the title the author of the page has given it. To access a URL
from the list, you only need to double click the title you are interested
in.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>HYPERLINKS</B> -&nbsp; One of the most powerful and useful features
on the World Wide Web. By clicking on a word or image on a web page, you
are automatically transferred to another position on either the same page
or another page somewhere on the web. Hyperlinks are indicated in Netscape
by showing text as underlined and in a different colour to the rest of
the text, graphics may have a border around them. In addition your cursor
will change to a hand whenever it passes over a hyperlink.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>HOME page</B> - When opening Netscape, a web page appears in your browser
window. This is called the HOME page. The HOME button on the menu bar will
automatically take you to the home page for which Netscape has been set
up on the internet workstation.</LI>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Search Engines</FONT></B>

<P>With more than 330 million web pages on the Internet it is a daunting
task to find relevant information on the Internet, specialised software
(computer programs) called search engines have been developed to assist
in this task. Search Engines allow the user to search through vast amounts
of data using keywords or concepts. The Internet consist of various parts
of which the web is just one. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) sites are another
aspect with thousand of sites providing computer files that could be downloaded
to the user, there is also Usenet which is a discussion forum that contains
over 20 000&nbsp; discussion groups. Although most search engines specifically
targets the web, some of the well known search engines such as Excite and
Alta Vista search Usenet as well.

<P>Search engines are automated software, it constantly scans the web for
new web sites or recently updated ones, when it does find a site it index
or catalog a site according to predefined criteria within the program,
there is no direct human intervention in this process. Most of the web
sites however do allow a web master (owner/maintainer of a web site) to
catalog a site for inclusion in the search engine database. Popular search
engines include Alta Vista, Infoseek, HotBot, and Lycos.

<P>Directories also known as registries operate in a different fashion.
Sites on the web are actually reviewed to determine whether in warrants
inclusion under certain headings, when using a well known directory such
as Yahoo for example the hits listed for a search topic would be a lot
less than for the automated search engines but it is to be expected that
the sites listed would be more topical and of better quality.

<P>Search engines such as Excite and Alta Vista uses concept based indexing
which means that when you enter keywords, the search engine attempts to
determine what you mean and would return hits on the subject or theme that
you are exploring. This is a step towards artificial intelligence, it is
however not flawless and the web surfer should enter many keywords relating
to the search topic for the best results.

<P>Different search engines often return markedly different results for
the same searches, it is a good idea to use 2 or 3 search engines for a
web search. Search engines may take anything up to two months to add a
new web site to its database so if you are looking for a new topic it might
not yet be available on search engines.

<P>Another way to go about a search would be to go for related sites for
example if the search topic is about mining you might go to the home page
of&nbsp; the SA Chamber of Mines and follow the hyper links from there.
It could also be possible to guess the URL of the site you are interested
in.&nbsp; Each domain name (URL) can be divided into four or five parts.
The first part indicate the resources 'http://' - hypertext transfer protocol,
if you are browsing hypertext linked web pages on the World Wide Web. The
second part is often 'www' though it need not be. The third part refer
to the web site's name and is very often the same as or similar to the
organisation's name. The fourth part refer to the type of organisation
involved e.g. 'com' for commercial, 'org' for non-profit organisations,
'gov' for government, 'co' for companies, 'mil' for military, 'net' for
networks, 'ac' for academic, 'edu' for educational etc. The last part of
the domain name refers to the country where the web site is located. Each
country accept for the United States has their own two letter abbreviation
e.g. 'za' is South Africa, 'de' for Germany, 'ca' for Canada.

<BR>Web gateways and forums often provide excellent starting points for
a web search. Web gateways are popular web sites that contains information
and links to a wide range of topics. Forums are more specialised and concentrate
on a specific topic with links to related sites dealing with the topic
of interest. An example of a web gateway would be the mweb site: http://www.mweb.com

<B>Quick Start</B></H3>

<H3>
<B>mount/unmount stiffy:</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
unlike some other operating systems such as Windows 98, a stiffy must be
"mounted" on the file system before it can be used (this feature allows
the user to mount the stiffy anywhere in the directory tree of the pc -
the default mount is set up as /mnt/floppy ).</LI>

<LI>
the stiffy can be mounted by double clicking with the left mouse button
on the "Floppy 0" icon on the desktop. This will bring up the Gnome "File
Manager" window displaying the files on the stiffy now mounted under the
folder /mnt/floppy on the directory tree of the pc</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or</CENTER>

<UL>right click with the mouse on the "Floppy 0" icon on the desktop
<UL>
<LI>
a menu would be displayed</LI>

<LI>
select the "Mount device" option (if the "Unmount device" option is displayed,
then a stiffy has been removed without first unmounting it, first select
the "Unmount device" option before proceeding to mount your own stiffy).</LI>

<LI>
To view the the files on the stiffy now mounted under the folder /mnt/floppy
on the directory tree of the pc, right click again on the "Floppy 0" icon
and select the "Open" option.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
a "mounted" stiffy must first be "unmounted" before it can be removed.
Right click with the mouse on the "Floppy 0" icon, select the "Unmount
device" option, the stiffy can now be removed from the stiffy drive of
the internet workstation. Note that it is physically possible to remove
a stiffy without first unmounting it, when trying to access the "Floppy"
drive or trying to mount the next stiffy there would be error messages
displayed. A workaround would be to select "Unmount device" before proceeding.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>

<LI>
the "login" page of hotmail will be displayed. A hotmail account can be
opened by clicking on "Sign Up Here" and following the instructions. Note
that there is a problem with the application form in that sometimes the
form does not want to accept entered text after the button selections have
been made (click with mouse on the provided buttons in order to set specific
options), a work around once the frame has frozen is to "reload" the web
page. To avoid the problem from occurring, first enter all the required
text before making button selections.</LI>

<LI>
To read and send mail:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
on the hotmail login page enter your username in the "Login Name" text
field and your password in the "Password" text field, click with the mouse
on the "Enter" button. A Netscape Security warning window would appear,
click the "Continue Submission" button.</LI>

<LI>
the "Inbox" of your hotmail account will be displayed. All new messages
will be displayed on this page. To read a message click on the displayed
sender name in the "from" column, the selected e-mail messages would be
loaded into the web page. To reply to this message, click on the "reply"
button displayed above the message.</LI>

<LI>
to send an e-mail message click on the "Compose" menu item displayed on
the top left hand side of the hotmail screen.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
enter the e-mail address of the person you want to send the message to
in the "To:" text field.</LI>

<LI>
enter the topic of the message in the "Subject:" text field.</LI>

<LI>
click inside the "text area" in the middle of the page and start to type
in the message you want to send. When finished, and you are ready to send
the message, click on the "Send" button at the top of the screen.</LI>

<LI>
a document can be attached to an e-mail message and send to the specified
e-mail address by selecting "attach" in the "compose" window.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<LI>
when finished with your hotmail, exit by selecting the "Log out" menu option
in the left hand margin of the hotmail screen.</LI>
