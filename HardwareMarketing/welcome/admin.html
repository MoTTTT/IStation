<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Basic Administration</H1>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>Your Internet Host has been configured for your hardware, and there
is little you should have to do to maintain the system. If you are interested
in system maintenance itself, or adding new hardware to your PC, then the
<A HREF="info.html">documentation pages</A>, and the man pages should be
consulted for details. </P>

<P>However, there are a number of things you might want to do through the
course of using the machine that requires access to privalaged files and
hardware. This includes adding new users, using the floppy drive, and configuring
your internet dial up scripts.</P>

<P>The rest of the <A HREF="help.html">Help</A> pages should be read first
for a basic introduction to the PC's facilities.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H1>Logging in as the administrator</H1>

<P>Access to restricted configuration files is gained by logging in as
&quot;root&quot; with the password delivered with the machine.</P>

<P>You should change this passwords with the &quot;<TT>passwd</TT>&quot;
command once you have logged in for the first time. ( Write your new password
down somewhere! ).</P>

<H1>Executing Commands</H1>

<P>A Unix shell, available from the Main Menu or the Button Bar, provides
a command prompt at which commands, such as &quot;<TT>adduser</TT>&quot;
(mentioned below) can be entered.</P>

<H1>Editing Configuration Files</H1>

<P>The following tools can be used to read and edit the configuration files,
most of which are to be found in the &quot;<TT>/etc</TT>&quot; sub-directory.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>TkDesk, an extensive file manager, is available from the Button Bar.</LI>

<LI>Midnight Commander, a Norton Commander look-alike available from the
Main Menu, has a built-in text viewer. Select a file and use the F3 hotkey
to view it's contents. A command prompt is also provided.</LI>

<LI><TT>vim</TT> (or Vi IMproved), an extensive text editor, is available
from the F4 hotkey in the Midnight Commander, or from a shell prompt. </LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H1>Creating new accounts</H1>

<P>An example user account has been created. This account, with user name
&quot;demo&quot; and password &quot;demo&quot;, can be used to demonstrate
the machine. (If you are concerned about security, you should disable this
account.)</P>

<P>Personal user accounts can be created by executing the &quot;<TT>adduser</TT>&quot;
command as root and following the prompts.</P>

<H1>Configuring your ISP connection</H1>

<P>The file <TT>/usr/sbin/ppp-on</TT> should be edited to suit your ISP's
telephone number, and account details.</P>

<P>Check that your ISP's username and password prompts are correct in the
file <TT>/etc/ppp/ppp-on-dialer</TT>.</P>

<P>The file /<TT>etc/ppp/options</TT> should be edited if you require PAP
authentication, and you will need to create a file called <TT>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</TT>
containing your account details.</P>

<P>Issue the command &quot;<TT>ppp-on</TT>&quot; to test the configuration.
The system logs on virtual console 8 (press &lt;crtl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;F8),
and in the <TT>/var/adm/logs</TT> directory can be viewed to see the progress
of authentication and log-on. The command &quot;<TT>ppp-off</TT>&quot;
can be issued to terminate the connection.</P>

<P>Read the <A HREF="/woven/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO.html">PPP-HOWTO</A> if you
need further information.</P>

<H1>Using the floppy drive</H1>

<P>The command &quot;<TT>mkf</TT>&quot; can be executed by the superuser
to mount an MS Dos floppy disk as the sub-directory &quot;<TT>~/floppy</TT>&quot;,
where the tilde, &quot;<TT>~</TT>&quot;, stands for your home directory.
If you are logged in as the superuser, this would appear as &quot;/<TT>root/floppy</TT>&quot;,
or if your user-name is user1, it will be mounted as &quot;<TT>/home/user1/floppy</TT>&quot;.
Similarly the command &quot;<TT>rmf</TT>&quot; should be issued before
removing the disk from the drive. </P>

<P>Any user can mount a floppy disk as a sub-directory of their home directory
using the &quot;Floppy, Mount&quot; option in the Main Menu. Once the user
is finished using the floppy, the sub-directory should be exited, and the
&quot;Floppy, Unmount&quot; option of the main menu selected. If either
the mount or the unmount option is unsuccesful, a message will be printed
to the console window (xconsole) indicating the problem. If the dismount
operation is successful, and once the disk activity has stopped (i.e. the
light on the floppy drive goes off), the floppy can be removed from the
drive.</P>

<H1>Shutting Down the Host</H1>

<P>It should not be necessary to reboot your Linux PC, or to switch it
off. If you would like to do so in order to move it, or add new hardware,
you may ssue the command &quot;<TT>reboot</TT>&quot; at a shell prompt.
An alternative is to press &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;DEL&gt; while in
the text console.</P>
