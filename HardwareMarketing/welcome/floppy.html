<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Using the floppy drive</H1>

<P>An MS Dos floppy disk can be used if you have a floppy disk drive installed.</P>

<P>The contents of the disk can be displayed in your home directory as
the sub-directory &quot;floppy&quot; by selecting the &quot;Floppy: Mount&quot;
option from the Main Menu.</P>

<P>Files can now be read from the floppy disk, or files saved on it. </P>

<P>Before removing the floppy disk from the drive, make sure it is not
still in use by one of your programs. Once all files on the floppy are
closed, and no program is browsing the &quot;floppy&quot; sub-directory,
the &quot;Floppy: Unmount&quot; option of the Main Menu should be chosen.</P>

<P>There may be some floppy disk drive activity (the floppy drive light
comes on, etc) after unmounting the floppy disk. This happens when an earlier
file save operation has been buffered, and is now being completed. If the
disk is removed before unmounting it, the completion of file save operations
can not take place, and damage to the disk can result.</P>

<P>Wait until all disk activity stops, and then remove the disk from the
drive.</P>

<P>If either the mount or the unmount option is unsuccesful, a message
will be printed to the console window (xconsole) indicating the problem.
