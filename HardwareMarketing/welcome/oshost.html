The Linux Office Server
			</h1>	<p>
The Office Server provides printing, file serving and backup facilities
to a Local Area Network.

This configuration includes the SAMBA software suite, which implements the SMB protocol 
(sometimes referred to as the LanManager or NETBIOS protocol)
allowing Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 clients to share printers and files.
